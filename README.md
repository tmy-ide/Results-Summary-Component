## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned the difference between nth-of-type and nth-child and how they're used. I had issues with nth-child but stepping back and taking the time to learn how to use it helped me understand the problem I was facing.
- I installed fonts for the first time. It was easy to do but 
a helpful thing to learn about.
- This is the first project which I had to create a component through a mobile viewport. So I had to learn the proper css rule to acheive that.

### Continued development

 Although I am developing my flexbox skills, I believe it will become necessary for me to learn how to use CSS grid soon in order to be more efficient in alignment.
