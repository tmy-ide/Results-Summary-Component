## Overview

A results summary component project that will be designed through desktop view and mobile view.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process
- Analyze the references and brainstorm
- Install certain assets 
- Write markup first
- Next, style with CSS
- Touch up and remove unnecessary codes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned the difference between nth-of-type and nth-child. I had issues with nth-child but stepping back and taking the time to learn how to use it helped me understand the problem I was facing.
- I installed fonts for the first time. It was easy to do but 
a useful thing to learn about.
- This is the first project that I had to create with mobile proportions. It felt a tad closer to what a real life project may entail.

### Continued development

 Although I am developing my flexbox skills, I believe it will become necessary for me to learn how to use CSS grid and position elements soon in order to be more efficient in aligning elements.
